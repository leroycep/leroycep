### Libraries

Some Libraries I've worked on:

### Games

- [Hexagonal Chess](https://github.com/leroycep/hexagonal-chess) -- A multiplayer implementation of Gli≈Ñski's hexagonal chess
- [2021 7 Day Roguelike](https://github.com/leroycep/2021-7drl) -- A game I worked on for the 2021 7 Day Roguelike Challenge, mainly used to split [seizer][] into it's own library
- [Snake Game](https://github.com/leroycep/snake-game) -- A snake game, but this time the snake doesn't stick to a grid
